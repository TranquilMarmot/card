# card

## Running

Via `npx`:

```sh
npx github:tranquilmarmot/card
```

Or locally:

```sh
npm install && npm run show
```

## Building

```sh
npm run build
```

This will overwrite [`bin/card`](bin/card) with a whatever is defined in [`build.ts`](build.ts)

```sh
./bin/show-card
```

Simply prints out whatever is in the [`bin/card`](bin/card) file.
